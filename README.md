# California Housing Price Prediction

This project performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) and builds a linear regression model to predict housing prices in California based on various features like income, age, and location.

## Project Overview
The goal is to understand the factors affecting house prices and create a predictive model. 

### Key Steps:
1. **Data Loading**: Analyzed a dataset with 20,640 entries and 9 features.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Created visualizations including histograms of prices and correlation heatmaps.
3. **Data Preprocessing**: Handled feature scaling and split data into training and testing sets.
4. **Modeling**: Implemented a Linear Regression model.
5. **Evaluation**: Evaluated performance using R2 score and RMSE.

## Insights
- **Income** has the strongest correlation (0.69) with housing prices.
- **Latitude** and **Income** were identified as the most impactful variables for the model.

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Open `california_housing (1).ipynb` in Jupyter or Google Colab.
